This documentation is intended for developers who want to modify the firmware of the Flipper Zero. If you are looking for the user manual, please visit [the User Documentation](https://docs.flipperzero.one/).

The documentation is divided into several sections, with all of them accessible from the sidebar on the left. Aside from the manually-written documentation files, there's also a few automatically-generated ones at the bottom of the list, and also in the header of each page:

* [Namespaces](namespaces.html)
* [Data Structures](annotated.html)
* [Files](files.html)

They are generated from the source code, and are useful for quickly finding the source code or API documentation for a particular function or data structure.
